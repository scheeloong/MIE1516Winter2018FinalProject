# MIE1516Winter2018FinalProject
Final Project for MIE1516 Final Project code, with python notebook, latex for math, and everything. 

## Datasets
The dataset was not uploaded to github as github doesn't allow it.
Therefore, to run, you need to first download, unzip and update the notebook to point
to the correct data location.

Data used:
